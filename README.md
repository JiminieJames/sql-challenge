This is the information for Module 9 Challenge Related to SQL for manipulating data and generating queries. 

The coding was completed by myself with reference to our activity modules as well as Xpert support as needed. 

I have included an image of the ERD, the Tables Creation SQL file, and the SQL file where I added my queries for your reference. 

I doubled check my constraint keys through tudor support.
